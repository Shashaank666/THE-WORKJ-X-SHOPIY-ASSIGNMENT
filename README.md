An accordion is a UI component that allows users to expand or collapse content sections. In this case, the requirement is to implement an accordion where only one section can be open at a time. When a user clicks on an accordion item to expand it, any other open item should automatically close. This ensures that only one item is expanded at a time.

Search Functionality:
The search functionality allows users to search for specific content within the accordion items. This typically involves adding a search input field where users can type keywords or phrases. As they type, the accordion items should be filtered based on the search term, showing only the items that match the search criteria.

Alphabet Filter:
The alphabet filter provides users with the ability to filter accordion items based on the starting letter of their titles. For example, if a user clicks on the letter "A" in the filter, only accordion items whose titles start with "A" should be displayed. This feature can be implemented using buttons or a dropdown menu containing letters of the alphabet.

In summary, the prompt requires you to create a web page with an accordion that supports single item opening, includes search functionality to search within accordion items, and provides an alphabet filter to filter items based on their titles' starting letters. These features enhance user experience and make it easier for users to navigate and find relevant information within the accordion.
